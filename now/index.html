	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
  <p>I am living in Seattle, where I stopped walking after leaving Chicago and to hike all 2,650 miles of the Pacific Crest trail from Mexico to Canada. Since then I have been happily consumed with being a full-time dad to my now almost-two-year-old son. I'm cautiously dangling my toes towards the waters of contract work but continuine to spend most of my free time on a pandemic project: building my idea of a great online bookstore, which I have begun to document at <a href="https://whatisabookstore.com">WhatIsABookstore.com</a>. Otherwise I've been having a great time exploring the Olympic peninsula of Washington, running, and learning more about contemporary poetry by picking a short poem to share most every day.</p>
